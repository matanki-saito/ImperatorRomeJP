 stonehenge.1.desc:0 "After months of travel in distant Britannia, [druid.GetName] has adopted an obscene form of dress. [druid.GetHerHis|U] hair flows to [druid.GetHerHis] shoulders, [druid.GetHerHis] tunic is embroidered with what appears to be the ribcage of a skeleton, and worst of all, [druid.GetSheHe] dons immodest barbarian trousers so tight [druid.GetSheHe] can barely move.\n\n\"The druidic rituals of the Britons are as music to my ears, and I have decided we must adopt some of their practices.\" He hands [sthubbins.GetName] a filthy rag with a filthy sketch of a stone monument displaying a handful of crude measurements. He leans forward and whispers: \"Stonehenge.\""

After a few steps, [druid.GetName] trips and falls flat. It seems [druid.GetSheHe] has tripped over a knee-high pile of stacked-up flat rocks — the monument is nowhere to be seen. It gradually dawns on [sthubbins.GetName] that this pile of rocks is the monument.\n\n[druid.GetName] seems unperturbed: \"Are we still doing Stonehenge tomorrow?\""

 stonehenge.3.desc:0 "Just moments before the Stonhenge unveiling ceremony in the central market of [main_stage.GetName], it is reported that the hired musicians meant to provide merriment during the event have tragically perished in a freak accident in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

After picking up a lyre, [sthubbins.GetName], in a new pair of barbarian trousers, copies the stance of [druid.GetName] - legs as far apart as possible.\n\n\"[sthubbins.GetName], lead lyre!\" cries [druid.GetName], to the crowd composed of the garrison of [main_stage.GetName] forced to assemble around the tiny stone circle."
