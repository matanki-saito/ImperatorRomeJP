[SCOPE.sChar('periplus_character')GetSheHe|U] has traded with faraway peoples, and ridden the largest elephants he has ever seen.\n\nFurthermore, to the great delight of the Senate, the worth of the exotic goods brought back on board the ship is enough to fund ten such expeditions!"

We discovered early on, however, that there was some friction between our native elephants and the new Indian ones. We have therefore decided to move them to their own enclave.\n\nAfter much prospecting, we have found a plot of land with fertile grazing opportunities in the hills near Carthage itself, where we expect the herd to thrive in the coming years."

From sunrise until well after sundown the Cothon is a bustling hub of activity, as citizens, merchants, sailors, and other less savory occupants of the docks ply their trade. Further afield the goods are brought to market, and market squares are brimming with commoners and wealthy alike.\n\nFrom all over the known world, Carthage is quickly becoming known as the Metropolis of the West."
