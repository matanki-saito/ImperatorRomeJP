From sunrise until well after sundown the Cothon is a bustling hub of activity, as citizens, merchants, sailors, and other less savory occupants of the docks ply their trade. Further afield the goods are brought to market, and market squares are brimming with commoners and wealthy alike.\n\nFrom all over the known world, Carthage is quickly becoming known as the Metropolis of the West."
