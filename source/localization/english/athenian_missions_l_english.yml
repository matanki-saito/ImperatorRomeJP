After the league was shattered, the relations between old members decayed, and were eventually replaced by obedience to Theban or Macedonian tyrants.\n\nIt is time to pick up the pieces of the past, and restore the Delian League to its former glory.

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_2_DESC:0 "Our ancient neighbors to the north were important members of the original Delian League, and should be once more. As they are located as closely as they are to Attica, it makes sense to start our campaign by convincing the city-states on Euboea."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_3_DESC:0 "The island of Kephalos lay far to the west, distant from the rest of the ancient capitals of the Delian League. If we are ever to expand the rule of the Delian League beyond those ancient borders, be it to Illyrian or Magna Graecian lands, we need ports like this."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_4_DESC:0 "Korkyra was the final bastion to the west of the ancient Delian League, the last stop one would make before entering Illyrian or Magna Graecian lands. As it lays at an important crossroads between Greece, the west, and the north, we should attempt to retake the island once more."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_5_DESC:0 "The Delian League were known for its navy, building ships and recruiting oarsmen across the whole Aegean Sea to serve its purpose.

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_14_DESC:0 "Sestos is one of the ancient members of the original Delian League, and is located at the entrance to the Hellespont. Controlling the city-state would give us access to the strait, and influence over anyone wanting to pass through."
