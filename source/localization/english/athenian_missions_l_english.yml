 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the golden age of Athens we controlled the Aegean Sea and were the hegemons of the Delian League, bringing wealth and riches from one side of the sea to the other. After the league was shattered, the relations between old members decayed, and were eventually replaced by obedience to Theban or Macedonian tyrants.\n\nIt is time to pick up the pieces of the past, and restore the Delian League to its former glory. A league where every city-state is free, headed by Athenian might and democracy.\n"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have restored the Delian League."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_1_DESC:0 "At one point, most of the Aegean Sea was under the control of our Delian League, until it was shattered by our envious neighbors. It is time to pick up the pieces."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_2:0 "Northern Neighbors"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_2_DESC:0 "Our ancient neighbors to the north were important members of the original Delian League, and should be once more. As they are located as closely as they are to Attica, it makes sense to start our campaign by convincing the city-states on Euboea."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_3:0 "Finding Kephalos"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_3_DESC:0 "The island of Kephalos lay far to the west, distant from the rest of the ancient capitals of the Delian League. If we are ever to expand the rule of the Delian League beyond those ancient borders, be it to Illyrian or Magna Graecian lands, we need ports like this."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_4:0 "The Last Delian Bastion"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_4_DESC:0 "Korkyra was the final bastion to the west of the ancient Delian League, the last stop one would make before entering Illyrian or Magna Graecian lands. As it lays at an important crossroads between Greece, the west, and the north, we should attempt to retake the island once more."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_5:0 "Athenian Strength"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_5_DESC:0 "The Delian League were known for its navy, building ships and recruiting oarsmen across the whole Aegean Sea to serve its purpose. If we are to control the city-states that lays inside the ancient borders of the league, we will have to build a navy of similar size."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_6:0 "The Home of Apollo"
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_6_DESC:0 "The island of Delos was the home of the treasury, and the namesake of the original Delian League. If we are to justify a new league, taking Delos is essential to justify its existence."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_7_DESC:0 "With the rise of the Diadochi and their kingdoms, we have seen the introduction of even larger ships in the naval engagements that take place between them.

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_8_DESC:0 "Naxos is at the heart of the Cyclades, and an important center for the Aegean islands. Controlling it will effectively make us the overseers of the other islands as well."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_12_DESC:0 "In one of the darker moments of the history of Athens, Samos was a loyal ally and friend of our city. It is time to restore their freedom, and the friendship between our two cities, we owe them that much."

 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_14_DESC:0 "Sestos is one of the ancient members of the original Delian League, and is located at the entrance to the Hellespont. Controlling the city-state would give us access to the strait, and influence over anyone wanting to pass through."
 athenian_mission_04_delian_league_task_15:0 "Securing the Hellespont"
