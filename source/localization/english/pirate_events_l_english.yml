 pirate_events.1.desc:0 "It has come to our attention that a pirate lair has sprung up in [SCOPE.sP('pirate_cove').GetName]. The local merchants and traders clamour for us to root out these pirates, so that their trade ships can continue to sail along our shores unmolested.\n\nAn advisor of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] comes up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] and says 'My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], I have a cunning plan...'."
 pirate_events.1.a:0 "We will dislodge these pirates! By force if necessary!"
 pirate_events.1.b:0 "'Oh! What is it?'"
 pirate_events.2.t:0 "Attack the Pirates"
 popular_ruler_pirate_attack_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], wary of losing favour with the local population, has decided to give in to its demands. After a year of preparation, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is finally ready to attack. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] advisors cannot agree, however, on whether it would be best to attack them by land or by sea."
 arrogant_ruler_pirate_attack_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has spent a year drilling [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] forces, gathering supplies, and making the necessary preparations. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] advisors cannot agree, however, on whether it would be best to attack them by land or by sea. Of course, they have turned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to make the decision, being the tactical genius that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is."

 pirate_events.3.t:0 "Embrace Piracy"
 pirate_events.3.desc:1 "Having decided to work with the pirates, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has sent envoys to their captain and established diplomatic relations. The pirates have shown interest in our overtures of cooperation, and claim they would be willing to work with us in exchange for our protection.\nThe question remains, however, as to how we would prefer to best make use of the pirates' skills. We will designate all of [SCOPE.sP('pirate_cove').GetState.GetShortName] a safe haven for pirates, and in return they will protect our trade, while forcibly diverting our neighbours' trade ships to our ports, or they will share their expertise and experience with our shipwrights and sailors."
 pirate_events.3.a:0 "They will kindly extend an invitation to passing trade ships to stop in our ports!"
 pirate_events.3.b:1 "They will strengthen our navy!"
 pirate_events.4.t:0 "Nearby Nation Harbors Pirates"
 pirate_events.4.desc:0 "It has come to the attention of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that our shores are regularly being raided by pirates. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe|U] assumes that this must be mildly annoying for the commoners, and so [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has sent scouts to the area. They have now returned and informed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] that the pirates raiding our shores are being harbored by our neighbours in [SCOPE.sState('pirate_state').GetCountry.GetName]! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] considers this a personal insult, and requests advice from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] advisors on how to proceed."
 pirate_events.4.a:0 "Certainly this cannot be allowed to continue!"
 pirate_events.4.b:0 "Perhaps we should avoid confrontation with our neighbors."

 pirate_events.5.desc:0 "An emissary has arrived from [SCOPE.sC('original_country').GetName], demanding that we immediately cease our patronage of the pirates in [SCOPE.sState('pirate_state').GetShortName]. Indeed they go further and demand that we crush the pirate threat to their lands once and for all. The emissary awaits the response from our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]."
