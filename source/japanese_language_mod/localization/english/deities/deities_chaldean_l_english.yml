 omen_ashshur:1 "アッシュール"
 omen_ashshur_desc:3 "Ashshur, the mighty god, the one whom by his furious eyes make foreign people and foes shake in fear and despair, again and again saved the country. Strong and exhilarated, his furor can be appeased only by the blood of battle, and by the honor and glory of the kings revering him in his temples.\n\nIn the old days, Ashshur permitted his kings and his princes to expand his power, and when he had settled upon their fate to be reversed, always did he restore them to their former glory. Assuredly, if he reaches his hand over us, we are certain to expand once again; to bring back from foreign lands their wealth, their men, women and children to labor for re-establishing our former glory and our former power!"

Ninurta alone could fight him, keeping his resolve in the battle.\n\nIf Ninurta looks with favor at our armies, assuredly we will prevail. If the great god favors us, we are certain our troops will push back those that drove us once, and we will submit to the tribute any of those people that surround us and that wished to create chaos in the country. Then, his sanctuaries at Nippur in Babylonia and at Kalhu in Assyria will be restored to their former glory, and the people once again will live in peace when our victory is achieved."

He will allow for the return of mighty kings, and will give them the rulership over far and away territories.
